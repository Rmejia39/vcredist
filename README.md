# VisualCppRedist AIO

## Overview:

- AIO Repack for latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes, without the original setup bloat payload.

- Built upon VBCRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe by **@ricktendo64**

- The process is handled by a windows command script, which runs hidden in the background by default.

- Before installation, the script will check and remove existing non-compliant Visual C++ Runtimes, including the original EXE or MSI setups, or older MSI packages versions.

- The uninstallation option/script will remove any detected VC++ runtimes (except UCRT).

- Windows XP support is partial, the pack will install and detect the latest runtimes versions, but it will not check and remove non-compliant versions.

- You can extract the installer file with 7-zip or WinRar to a short path, and run Installer.cmd as administrator

Examples:

Automatically install all packages and display progress:

Silently install all packages and display no progress:  
VisualCppRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe /ai /gm2

Silently install 2022 package:  
VisualCppRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe /ai9

Silently install 2010/2012/2013/2022 packages:  
VisualCppRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe /aiX239

Silently install VSTOR and Extra VB/C packages:  
VisualCppRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe /aiTE

Silently install all packages and hide ARP entries:  
VisualCppRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe /aiA /gm2
```

- **/y** gives the same default behavior, but without the beginning prompt and the finish message  

- only **/sfxlang** and **/gm2** can be specified with other switches  
if other switches are specified together, only the latest will have an effect. Example, this will only install Extra VB/C package:  
`/ai5 /ai8 /aiT /aiE`

- to install separate packages together, combine their latest switch character after **/ai** Example: **/ai58X239E**

- **/sfxlang** must be the first switch to have effect. Example:  
`/sfxlang:1031 /aiV`
